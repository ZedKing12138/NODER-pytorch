train  --- run train.ipynb(please change path when you want to fit another subject) 
infer  --- run infer.ipynb
visualize --- run visualize.ipynb


check deformation field --- use DFViewer to open  df-tx.nii.gz file(Download:https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dfviewer/)

We will update this repository rencently to check more details.
