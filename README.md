train  --- run train.ipynb(please change path when you want to fit another subject) <br>


infer  --- run infer.ipynb <br>


visualize --- run visualize.ipynb <br>


check deformation field --- use DFViewer to open  df-tx.nii.gz file(Download:https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dfviewer/) <br>

We will update this repository rencently to check more details.     <br><br><br>
